# 📊 **Battery Factory Power BI Dashboard**
This project presents a real-time analytics dashboard designed to help a battery manufacturing plant monitor production performance, defects, downtime, and first-pass yield. I transformed the raw factory dataset into a clean data model using Power Query and DAX, and designed visuals that help supervisors quickly identify bottlenecks, track performance trends, and support decisions that improve operational efficiency.
